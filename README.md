# csv2db

This was just a quick experiment in parsing CSV data and modelling it with Sequelize. To try it:

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run seed` to parse the CSV data and seed the database with them.
3. Run `npm run query` to test the one-to-many association between posts and comments.

The data are from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
